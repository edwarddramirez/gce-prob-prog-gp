Updates:

v0.1: Streamlined version of code made from a combination of most of the model files 
made in the gce-prob-prog directory.

v0.2: Updated naming scheme. 

    1. Now instead of the "poissonian_ed.py" defaulting to the "canon"
    simulation file. Now, you specify the name of the file in "data_file".
    
    2. Allow IDs to specify custom bulge templates and simulation ID.
    
    3. Allow for true hybrid templates
	
	4. Added v0.2 ID system
	
	5. Added custom grids for inducing points
	
v0.3: Custom SVI implementation

	1. Added basic custom SVI implementation
	
		Advantages:
			- GP sampling for f | u is now random
			- Can store state with minimum loss
			- Can define early-stopping
			- Can perform cross-validation/bootstrapping
